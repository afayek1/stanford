#Self-Taught Stanford Curriculum

For the past year, I have spent my free time learning about computer science and software engineering, and one of the best resources I have found are the publicly available [Stanford courses](http://see.stanford.edu/see/courses.aspx).

I will be using this repository to post my solutions to these courses. This is only meant to offer a portfolio of my work to future employers as I look to make a career change. These solutions will be taken down as soon as I find an internship, job, or until I begin contributing to the many great open source software available on GitHub! So if you're doing the same thing as I am, or enrolled in the actual course, I suggest you do not view this. Rather, post your questions in a forum like StackOverflow. If you're still having difficulty, email me and I will try my best to take time and go over something with you.

##Courses
